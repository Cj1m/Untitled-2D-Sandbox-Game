jobby-5
=======

the fifth big crap
------------------

This is a collaboration between Cj1m and 8BitSandy. It is also a prototype, so the code may seem very messy and cluttured at the moment.
Jobby-5 will be the first Java game I have finished (Cj1m).

Here is the to do list for the game (which I (Cj1m) am hoping to finish by 23rd July 2014).
In chronological order:

- [x] Get collision done well enough (efficient and working)
- [ ] Break blocks with the mouse instead of the arrow keys
- [ ] Make blocks tougher to break
- [ ] Make a timer for the sides to drop off
- [ ] Implement crafting
- [ ] Draw some boss art
- [ ] Implement the boss
- [ ] Implement boss features
- [ ] completed

BONUS TASK

- [ ] Make an ending for the game

I have just over 9 days to complete this, and since 8BitSandy, the game artist, is on holiday, I am going to have to
draw the rest of the game by myself (lucky it is just a prototype)

During these 9 days I will be Vlogging every so often on my Youtube account http://youtube.com/cj1mckay and you will be able to track 
my progress on this github page aswell.

Well, that is all, time to get coding!
